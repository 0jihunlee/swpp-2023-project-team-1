## Overview
Spire: A Diffusion model driven Social Network Service  
Spire is designed to be a dedicated hub where users can easily integrate and share AI-generated images. Users can effortlessly regenerate their images in any way they desire by using our user-friendly interface, which enables simple prompting and image mask drawing with the aid of auto-generated masks. This will lower the threshold of utilizing AI and foster creativity by offering a unique platform where individuals can share their enhanced imaginative expressions, enriched by generative AI.
